        <p className="text-md my-2">
          Welcome to OpenEnded ("We", "Us", "Our"). This Policy Agreement
          outlines the terms under which we provide access to our app (“App”).
          By using the App, you (“User”, “You”) agree to the terms set forth in
          this Agreement.
        </p>

        <p className="text-2xl my-4">1. Role as Intermediary</p>
        <p className="text-md my-2">
          Our App links Users to third-party Intellectual Property (IP) service
          providers (“IP Providers”). We act solely as an intermediary to
          facilitate the connection and payment process between Users and IP
          Providers. We do not provide any IP services ourselves and are not
          responsible for the performance or outcome of services provided by IP
          Providers.
        </p>

        <p className="text-2xl my-4">2. Payment Processing</p>
        <p className="text-md my-2">
          Payments for IP services are processed through Stripe, a third-party
          payment processor. Users will pay us directly, and we will retain a
          20% service fee from the total payment before remitting the remaining
          amount to the IP Provider. Users are charged for the full amount at
          the time of purchase.
        </p>

        <p className="text-2xl my-4">3. Revenue Sharing with IP Providers</p>
        <p className="text-md my-2">
          We have entered into agreements with IP Providers outlining the
          revenue-sharing model, where we retain 20% of the payment made by the
          User, and the remaining 80% is paid to the IP Provider. The IP
          Provider is responsible for fulfilling the services purchased by the
          User.
        </p>

        <p className="text-2xl my-4">4. Refunds and Disputes</p>
        <p className="text-md my-2">
          Refunds and dispute resolutions will be handled in accordance with our
          Refund Policy. We will mediate disputes between Users and IP Providers
          but are not liable for the outcome of such disputes.
        </p>

        <p className="text-md my-2">
          Users and IP Providers are responsible for their own tax obligations,
