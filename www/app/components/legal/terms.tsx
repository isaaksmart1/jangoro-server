      <p className="text-2xl my-4">3. User Responsibilities</p>

      <p className="text-md my-2">
        As a User ("You"), you are responsible for the information you provide
        on OpenEnded. This includes, but is not limited to, creating a user
        profile and posting ideas. You agree to provide proof of ownership of
        your ideas through our 'Copyright' feature, understanding that the
        approval process may take up to 2 working days.
      </p>

      <p className="text-md my-2">
        When engaging with content, a specific option is provided to express
        collaborative interest in an idea. By selecting this option, you
        indicate your desire to explore the idea further from a collaboration
        perspective.
      </p>

      <p className="text-md my-2">
        Upon expressing collaborative interest, you will be automatically
        included in an email shortlist of individuals who share a similar
        interest in pursuing the idea. This shortlist is intended for
        communication related to the specific idea.
      </p>

        will be shared with the creator of the idea. This disclosure is
        necessary for facilitating communication and collaboration regarding the
        expressed collaborative interest.
      </p>

      <p className="text-md my-2">
        Your registered email address will only be visible to the idea creator
        and will not be disclosed to other users external to or within the
        shortlist. This measure ensures the confidentiality of your contact
        information within the context of pursuing the shared collaborative
        interest.
