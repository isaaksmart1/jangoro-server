        Please take these rules seriously. If a OpenEnded creator's on and/or
        off-platform behaviour harms our users, community, employees or
        ecosystem, we may respond based on a number of factors including, but
        not limited to, the egregiousness of their actions and whether a pattern
        of harmful behaviour exists. Our response will range from suspending a
        creator's privileges to account termination.
